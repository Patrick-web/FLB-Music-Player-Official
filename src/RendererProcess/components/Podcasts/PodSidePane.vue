    As you can see this feature is still in development🔨⛏. Another banger💣💥
    of course. FLB Podcast🎙 will be the 🥇first🥇 platform to provide
    📝Comments📝 for podcasts. The Driving force of FLB Podcast is creating a
    community. The aspect of communities in Podcasts has been totally ignored by
    all other platforms creating a gap that you and I will swiftly fill.
